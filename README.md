# Email Spam Detection
We all receive a lot of emails in our daily life. Some emails are also very meaningless and irrelevant. We call such emails "spam". So, would you like to know which e-mail is spam and which is ham?

## DATASET
Dataset consist of two classes. These are "ham" and "spam". We have **4825** ham data and **747** spam data. The dataset is heavily unbalanced.

## TRAINING
We have trained the data set with the machine learning algorithms. 

* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machine
* KNN
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

Below, for each algorithm you can see the accuracy.

You can also do your predicts for each algorithm or you can choose one for prediction.
